# Coffee_shop_customer_visits
This excel spreadsheet helps the coffee shop or restaurant to track on how many times that customers have visited by entering the last 3 digits of their phone number. When they hit 10 times, they can get a free coffee for example.

1. Go to "Lookup_sheet" table, and enter the last 3 digits of the customer's phone number into cell A3.
2. The blue-highlighted cells will tell you the details of the person
3. After that, you will go to the customer's row in the "Data" sheet, and update the number of their visits
4. You can absolutely customise the number of visits to hit to get the free coffee. Make sure once the customer gets their free coffee, update the number of visits to 0.
